/// to OpenAI's Realtime API. It handles authentication, connection lifecycle, and logging.

/// - Important: This class is designed to be used as an actor to ensure thread-safe access to its properties and methods.
///
/// - Note: The class name "SakuraKit" is inspired by the cherry blossom (æ¡œ, sakura), symbolizing beauty and transience in Japanese culture. ðŸŒ¸
